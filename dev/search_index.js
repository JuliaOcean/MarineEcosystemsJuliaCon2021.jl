In this workshop, you will learn to use packages from the JuliaOcean and JuliaClimate organizations that provide a foundation for studying marine ecosystems across a wide range of scales. We will run agent-based models to explore individual microbes and processes that drive species interactions. On the other end of the model hierarchy, we will simulate planetary-scale transports that control ocean biogeography and climate change.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Notebooks","page":"MarineEcosystemsJuliaCon2021.jl","title":"Notebooks","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"MarineEcosystemsJuliaCon2021.jl","title":"MarineEcosystemsJuliaCon2021.jl","text":"Any example found in the online documentation is most easily run using Pluto.jl .
